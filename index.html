            <h2 id="about" class="sub">What is Architecture</h2>
            <p class="ii">Architecture is the art of science and designing and constructing buildings, spaces, and
                environment.
                It involves creating structures that are functional, safe and visually appealing.
                Architects consider factors like aesthetics, usability, sustainability,
                and cultural impact to design spaces that meet human needs.

            <h2 class="sub">Why is Architecture Important?</h2>
            <p class="ii">Architecture shapes the way we live, work, and interact with our surroundings. From homes and
                schools to offices and museums,
                every space influences our emotions and behaviour. It also reflects history, culture,
                and technological progress, preserving traditions while embracing innovation.

            <h2 class="sub">What Do Architects Do?</h2>
            <p class="ii">Architects design functional, safe, and visually appealing structures.
                They plan layouts, choose materials, and ensure buildings meet safety standards. Beyond creating
                blueprints, they solve problems,
                balance aesthetics with practically, and bring creative visions to life.

        <h2 class="sub2">Why Choose Architecture as a Major?</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><b>Creative Field: </b>Combines art, science, and engineering.</li>
            <li><b>Impactfull Career: </b>Shapes cities, communities, and the environment.</li>
            <li><b>Job Opportunities: </b>From urban design to sustainable planning.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2 class="sub2">What Do Architecture Students Learn?</h2>
        <p class="iii">Architecture students cover a wide range of topics that prepare them to design, plan and
            construct functional
            and aesthetically pleasing structures. <strong>Below is a breakdown of the key subjects they study:</strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="sub2">1. Design Principles and Drafting</h2>
        <p class="iii">This subjesct focuses on teaching students the foundational concepts of design, including balance
            symmetry,
            proprtion and scale. It emphasizes visual communication through sketches, blueprints, and computer-aided
            design (CAD) tools.
            Students learn to translate ideas into detailed plans and drawings that guide construction.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="sub2">2. Architectural History and Theory</h2>
        <p class="iii">Students explore the evolution of architecture from ancient civilizations to modern times. They
            analyze
            famous architectural styles, movements, and landmark structures to understand how cultural, social, and
            technological
            influences shape design. This knowledge helps students draw inspiration and develop a sense of style
            and context in their own work.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="sub2">3. Structural Engineering Basics</h2>
        <p class="iii">This area introduces students to the science of how buildings stand up. Topics include forces,
            loads, and stress
            analysis. Students learn about beams, columns, foundations, and load-bearing walls to ensure their designs
            are safe, stable,
            and functional.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="sub2">4. Construction Materials and Methods</h2>
        <p class="iii">Students study various building materials like concrete, steel, wood, and glass. They learn about
            material
            properties, durability, and sustainability. Construction methods, including assembly techniques and project
            management,
            are also covered to help students understand how designs are brought to life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="sub2">5. Sustainable Design and Mothern Technologies</h2>
        <p class="iii">This subject focuses on eco-friendly practices, energy-efficient buildings, and the use of smart
            technologies.
            Students explore renewable materials, green building certifications, and innovations like solar panels and
            rainwater
            harvesting. They also learn how to integrate modern tools like 3D printing and virtual reality into
            architectural design.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="sub2">6. Practical Training: Studio Work, Modeling, and Internships</h2>
        <p class="iii">Architecture programs include hands-on training through studio-based projects where students
            create models and
            prototypes. They practice problem-solving, experiment with designs, and receive feedback from instructors.
            Internships further
            provide real-world experience, allowing students to work with professional architects and gain insights into
            the industry.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="iii"><small>These subjects collectively help students build the knowledge, skills, and confidence
                needed to
                succeed in the field of architecture.</small>
